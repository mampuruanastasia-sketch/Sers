/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the SERS application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Users can only
 * access their own profile data and incident reports. This is achieved
 * primarily through path-based authorization for profiles and document-based
 * authorization for incident reports. Admins have broader read access and can
 * update incident statuses.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}/profile/{profileId}`.
 * - Incident reports are stored in a top-level collection `/incidentReports/{reportId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is enabled for signed-in users (admins) via a collection group query.
 * - Read-only collections are not present in this data model.
 * - The default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict: deny all.
 * - Admin roles are checked by reading the user's profile during write operations.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `userId` is stored within each incident report document to enable
 *   document-based access control (DBAC), as path-based ownership is not used
 *   for the top-level `incidentReports` collection.
